Here is a collection of Group Theory notes from self studying I did over the semester. They are based on the Group Theory section of Contemporary Abstract Algebra by Joseph A. Gillian. They are written in a Therom Proof format with little comments, since this is meant to supplement a class in Group Theory I will be taking.
