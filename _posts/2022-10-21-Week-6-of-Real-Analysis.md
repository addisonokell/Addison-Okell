This week we continued with the basic topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We started by defining a ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, mainly the set $B_{r}(\vec{p})=\{||\vec{x}-\vec{p}||<r:\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n, r>0\}$. These are important because if for every point in a set U we can define some ball such that the ball is completely contained in the set U then we say, the set U is open. we then state a Theorem that says A is a open set if and only if the completment of A is a closed set. 

We then started to talk about compact sets. A set is compact if for any sequence in the set there is a subsequence in the set such that the limit of the subsequence is a point in the set. We then talked about an important lemma that says a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and bounded. Bounded in higher dimension means that there is some ball $B_r(\vec{0})$ such that we can contain the entire set within this ball by picking a large enough r.
