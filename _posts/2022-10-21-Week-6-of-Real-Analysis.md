This week we continued with the basic topology of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We started by defining a ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, mainly the set $B_{r}(\vec{p})=\{||\vec{x}-\vec{p}||<r:\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n, r>0\}$. These are important because if for every point in a set U we can define some ball such that the ball is completely contained in the set U then we say, the set U is open.
