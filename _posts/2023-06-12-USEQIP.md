Over the last two weeks, I participated in the Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing. During these two weeks, we did A TON. Every day was filled with theoretical lectures on quantum 
information processing and quantum mechanics. Some of my favourite lectures included An Introduction to Quantum Information Processing by Professor W. Slofstra and Trapped-Ion QIP by K. R. Islam. During the later half 
of the day, we usually had labs where we got to put to work the knowledge we just gained in the lecture or tour some labs at IQC. 

My favourite lab was the Low Temp Lab by G. Nichols where we first got to solder a wire
with some resistors and dip this in liquid nitrogen to measure the change in resistance and convert this to a temperature. We then saw the dilution refrigerator being built to cool a chip down passed the critical 
temperature to do some quantum computation. Finally, we got to see a really cool demonstration using liquid helium-3 and -4 to create a superfluid. We watched as the liquid in a nano-porous cup was originally able
to be lifted out of the liquid, but once passed the critical temperature to form a Bose-Einstein condensate, was able to pass through the cup. Here are some photos of that lab.
