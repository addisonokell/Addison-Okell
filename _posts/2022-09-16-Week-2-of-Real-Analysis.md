This week we started with the defintion of a limit. A limit can be defined by taking some boundary we would like to keep the error within of the limit and defining a way to find a point in the sequence such that at this point and every point after is within this error. More formally we define say the limit of a function exists and coverges to a limit $L$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $N \geq$ such that $|a_n-L|< \epsilon$.
