This week I started my first Real Analysis course PMATH/AMATH 331. We started with a small review of equivalent classes and then started talking about how to build the real numbers. We started with reviewing what the rational numbers were and showing that the same tools we use in the real number are also true for the rationals. Mainly we have that we can add and subtract elements, multiply them and have an idea of ordering. We then started building the real numbers by doing an infinite decimal expansion where we take a rational number's digits and expand it using the formula $$a_0+\frac{a_1}{10}+\frac{a_2}{100}...=a_0.a_1a_2...$$. This way we can write every rational as an infinite set of digits. More formally we say an infinite decimal expansion is a map that takes each index in of the number in and maps to a digit between 0 and 9 for everything past the first digit and to an integer for the first. This way we build the irrationals by doing this an infinite number of times. We then have an intuitive sense of addition as we add the digits of two numbers just like we were taught in elementary school. We also have a sense of order as we can compare two numbers by comparing the digits. If we start from the left and go right comparing the digits of two numbers, we can tell when one is larger than the other as one digit we eventually be larger than the other number's digit. We then quickly talked about the Archimedean property and the absolute value function.

Next, we moved on to defining the Supremum, Infimum, max and min of sets. To do this we started by defining the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of sets. An upper bound is a number larger than every number in the set. A lower bound is a number smaller than every number in the set. The least upper bound, that is, the number that is an upper bound but smaller than every other upper bound we have a least upper bound. The greatest lower bound is a number smaller than every number in the set but larger than every other lower bound. If a set has a maximum value we define this as its max and Supremum denoted $$Sup(S)$$ for a set $$S$$. This also happens to be the set's least upper bound. When a set has a minimum value we define it as its min and Infimum denoted $$Inf(S)$$. This also happens to be the set's greatest lower bound. When a set does not include its max/min value or when a set is defined as a sequence that goes on forever, we say the set does not have a max/min. It may however still have a Supremum and or Infimum. Finally, we proved the Least Upper Bound Principle, which in most Real Analysis classes is part of the axioms called The Completeness Axiom.
