We started this week with a brief summary of Linear Algebra. The main points we discussed were the eculdiean norm, Euler-Schwarz ineqauilty, the triangle ineqauilty and orthonormal sets. Breifly, the eculdian norm is the regular norm to mesure distance in a vector space. It is the equation $\|\|\vec{V}\|\|=(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \|v_i\|^2)^{\frac{1}{2})$
