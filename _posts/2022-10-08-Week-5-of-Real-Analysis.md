We started this week with a brief summary of Linear Algebra. The main points we discussed were the eculdiean norm, Cauchy-Schwarz ineqauilty, the triangle ineqauilty and orthonormal sets. Breifly, the eculdian norm is the regular norm to mesure distance in a vector space. It is the equation $$\|\vec{v}\|=(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \|v_i\|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}})$$ where $v_i$ is the componets of the vector $\vec{v}$. This norm mesure the length of a vector. An important property of the norm is $$\<\vec{x},\vec{x}\>=\|\|\vec{x}\|\|^2$$ where $\<\vec{x},\vec{x}\>$ is the dot product of $\vec{x}$ with itself. The Cuachy-Shwarz inequailty then says that for any two vectors $\vec{x}, \vec{y}$ we have $$\|\<\vec{x},\vec{y}\>\| \leq \|\|\vec{x}\|\|\|\|\vec{y}\|\|$$ The proof of this is quite simple
