Over the last two weeks I got to partcipate in the Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing. During these two weeks we did A TON. Every day was filled with theoretical lectures on quantum 
information processing and quantum mechanics. Some of my favourite lectues included An Introduction to Quantum Information Processing by professor W. Slofstra and Trapped-Ion QIP by K. R. Islam. During the later half 
of the day we ussually had labs where we got to put to work the knowledge we just gained in the lecture or tour some labs at IQC. My favourite lab was the Low Temp Lab by G. Nichols where we first got to solder a wire
with some resitors and dip this in liquid nitrogen to mesure the change in resistance and convert this to a tempature. We then got see the dilution refigerator being built to cool a chip down passed the critical 
tempature to do some quauntum computation. Finally, we got to see a really cool demenstration using liquid helium-3 and -4 to create a superfluid. We watched as the liquid in a nano pourous cup was orginally able
to be lifted out of the liquid, but once passed the critical tempature to form a bose enstine condensate, was able to pass through the cup. Here are some photos of that lab.
