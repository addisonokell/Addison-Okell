Hi! I'm Addison Okell. I am from a small town in North Western Ontario called Red Lake. I graduated from Red Lake District High School in 2019 and started my undergraduate degree at the Universtiy of Waterloo in Physics but eventually changed to Mathematical Physics. I really developed my passion for Math in grade 8 when I was first taught linear equations. The idea that I could write down an equation and know exactly where every point was mapped to fascinated me and since then math has been one of my biggest hobbies.
