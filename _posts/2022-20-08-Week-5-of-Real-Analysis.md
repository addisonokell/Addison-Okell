We started this week with a brief summary of Linear Algebra. The main points we discussed were the eculdiean norm, Euler-Schwarz ineqauilty, the triangle ineqauilty and orthonormal sets. Breifly, the eculdian norm is the regular norm to mesure distance in a vector space. It is the equation $$\|\|\vec{V}\|\|=(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \|v_i\|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}})$$ where $v_i$ is the componets of the vector $\vec{V}$. This norm mesure the length of a vector. An important property of the norm is $$\braket{\vec{x},\vec{x}}=\|\|\vec{x}\|\|^2$$
