Hi! I'm Addison Okell. I am from a small town in North Western Ontario called Red Lake. I graduated from Red Lake District High School in 2019 and started my undergraduate degree the same year at the Universtiy of Waterloo in Physics, but eventually changed to Mathematical Physics. I really developed my passion for Math in grade 8 when I was first taught linear equations. The idea that I could write down an equation and know exactly where every point was mapped to fascinated me and since then math has been one of my biggest hobbies. I hope that I will be able to do reseach in Theoretical Physics and have a job as a professor at a university. This blog will be a place where I can discuss things that interest me and post some of my studying notes for future me.
